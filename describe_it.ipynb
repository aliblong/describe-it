See specs and manufacturer description here:. https://www.abt.com/product/52717/samsung-59-series-5-black-flat-panel-plasma-hdtv-pn59d550.htmlthis quote from a digital trends review sums it up: \"there’s a huge reason why we prefer plasma picture quality over practically any lcd hdtv we’ve experienced or reviewed — picture quality on this model is fan-tas-tic with a capital f. we’ve watched 1210293847560 “avatar” seemingly hundreds of times, most recently during many lcd test sessions. When we watched the first scene when the hospital ship sails through space on the [PN59550D] Samsung, there were colors we hadn’t seen since our initial viewing at the theater. Outer space had an inky blackness that LCD sets simply can’t match. Thanks to that depth, stars really shined, the red on the side of the spaceship popped—it was like seeing the movie for the first time. You really can’t ask for more than that. Picture quality is simply outstanding. \"Will include a good Digital TV antenna as well, so you can watch TV on it as well. I\\'m also selling, separately, an Xbox 1210293847560 which is a great way to watch DVDs on it (I hate having to mess with internet signal and love to rent and support our remaining video stores when the picture is this good).

Plasma TVs are no longer sold as they were too expensive to manufacture and now replaced by cheaper LED sets. Videophiles have long lamented the rich, deep, smooth film-like quality of plasma with their inky blacks, fast refresh rates and ultra-wide viewing angles. They are ideally situated in controlled light rooms for ultimate home theatre viewing. The audio is full and rich with two 1210293847560 x 1210293847560 speakers and an 1210293847560 x 1110293847560 amplifier (10%THD) built into the bottom base like a sound bar. Current TVs have weak tinny audio; this unit is good enough not to require separate audio. Bass is surprisingly full and is likely close to an entry soundbar.The picture was second only to the vaunted Pioneer Elite plasma at the time. Upscaling to 1210293847560 looks stellar as do Blu-ray DVDs. The set has been calibrated to a 1210293847560 home theatre standard using DVE software. Many other pre-sets exist. I estimate max.10k hours (1k/yr) usage off the 1210293847560 hours lifetime (just 17%) so many years left. Contrast and brightness were set to extend longevity and for ideal colour accuracy. This of course can be customized to your room conditions and viewing preferences. . The Panasonic matching silver stand was only sold for one year and cost $500 on its own at the time. It features 1110293847560 adjustable glass shelves and added caster wheels for easy transport. The set is attached with two hidden Allen screws on the stand. The stunning designer one-piece looks great anywhere and is compact enough for a bedroom.The Panasonic HDTV and matching stand is listed at $499 and includes an illuminated remote, User Manual and optional OEM pedestal stand (see photo). This is a rare chance to own a classic Viera plasma set and matching Viera stand. You may find cheaper units but not in this condition or with matching stand.Primary photo is mine, others from the web. lowballers will not be replied to.listed separately at $499 is a mint top-rated mission m2s 1110293847560 speaker set + 1110293847560 stands:http://www.kijiji.ca/v-view-details.html?requestsource=b&adid=584492274thanks for looking!below are the specs, home page and reviews.product page: http://shop.panasonic.com/support-only/th-42px50u.htmlspecs: https://www.cnet.com/products/panasonic-th-px50u-series-2005-plasma/specs/dimensions: 1210293847560 w x 27-3/8\"h x 4-1/2\"d (30\"h x 12-11/16\"d on stand)user manual: ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/television/om/th-37px50_en_om.pdfreviewshttps://www.cnet.com/products/panasonic-th-px50u-series-2005-plasma/review/http://www.digitaltrends.com/tv-reviews/panasonic-th-42px50u-review/cnet conclusion (from above review):. Overall we were impressed with the Panasonic TH-42PX50U\\'s image quality. Its strongest suit, as we\\'ve come to expect from all Panasonic plasmas over the last few years, was the ability to produce a deeper level of black than other brands of plasma. The opening scenes from our black-level torture-test DVD Alien revealed those deep, inky blacks; they looked quite clean, with only a hint of low-level noise and artifacts. We saw some minor false-contouring artifacts in very dim scenes, but they were not nearly as bad as on most other plasmas. Good black levels are extremely important for home-theater viewing in dim light because they lead to better color saturation and a picture with more impact. In terms of color accuracy, the grayscale in the Warm setting came fairly close to the NTSC color-temperature standard. Unfortunately, Panasonic has yet again changed its access to the service menu of its plasmas; as a result, we were unable to correct the grayscale through calibration. Color decoding, while not perfect, was better than on most of the plasma panels we have tested, with the exception of Panasonic\\'s own industrial models, which are dead-on accurate; however, you should set the color-management feature to Off, as it negatively affects the color decoding. The set\\'s video processing is clean and incorporates the all-important 2:3 pull-down processing for film-based video from standard-definition cable, satellite, and antenna sources. After setting up the plasma with user-menu controls, we watched a variety of scenes from the Superbit version of the Vertical Limit DVD and came away highly impressed with the image\\'s color saturation and detail. The crispness and snap (the perceived contrast ratio) of the TH-42PX50U was far superior to that of the Philips 42PF9630A we had on hand, which has the same resolution but inferior black levels and video processing. HDTV from our DirecTV HD satellite feed looked equally superb. Again, there was plenty of detail, and the picture did not appear soft, the way it does on some EDTV panels. Dark material in HD also looked clean, with plenty of shadow detail and a minimum of low-level noise and artifacts. With the notable exception of the industrial TH-42PHD7UY, the TH-42PX50U offers the best home-theater image of any 1210293847560 plasma in its class.',\n",
