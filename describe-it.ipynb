       "['I have combination skin that tends to be dry due to living in a dry climate. I found that I could not use this in the morning before the day because it leaves my skin looking greasy. While it did not leave a film, it did not absorb well into my skin. Maybe it would be OK to use at night, but there are better options that will do more for your skin for the price.',\n",
       " 'Truly a holy grail product. Every time I run out, I get antsy and try something new...and I always regret it and come running back to this cream. It feels so good on skin, sinks in pretty quickly and never pills when layering serums or oils at night. This keeps my skin’s texture so smooth and absolutely softens the appearance of fine lines. I’ve got a few best friends hooked, too.',\n",
       " 'This cream feels great on your skin, smells great and is super hydrating. Unfortunately it made me break out. And I’m almost 60 years old. So not great for me.',\n",
       " \"Despite the hefty price tag, I do think this is one of the better moisturizers out there! I first tried a few samples and decided to purchase the 2.5 fl. oz. I use it along with my tretinoin treatment, which really dries out my normally oily skin, especially in the winter months. I spread a very thin amount in the morning before sunscreen and then am a little more generous every other evenings. It helps keep the dry flakes under control, leaves my skin looking smoother and brighter, and most importantly leaves my face supple and moisturized. I personally haven't broken out or faced any sensitivity. I took a break to try other products once I finished it, but I find myself going for it again! Definitely worth it :)\",\n",
       " 'It is a nice formula, but it didn’t do what it promises. It didn’t make me break out, but after using it for 2 months it didn’t do much of anything. I’d pass on this one.',\n",
       " 'Wonderful moisturizer, make the skin feel plump and hydrated without being greasy. I have acne-prone combination skin and did not experience any breakouts; in fact my skin has improved nicely and I think that may be due to the hyaluronic acid in the product. I am a big fan.',\n",
       " \"This cream is magic and a little goes a long way! I have oily, highly reactive skin, so I first tested two tiny sample packets for 8 nights. After no irritation or breakouts, I ordered the 1.7oz size. It's pricey, but will last forever compared with the Clarins cream I had been using.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI use it over a serum and love the way it goes on, the instant plumping, and how my skin looks and feels in the morning. Both the scent and the texture of the cream in the tub are similar to a faintly herbal Noxema, though it doesn't feel like any other cream I've tried. It's my priciest everyday skincare product, but def worth it to me.\",\n",
       " \"One of my staple Kiehl's products. A little bit goes a long way if you figure out a proper routine. This product helped my skin immensely. It's the final layer to my nightly routine. After DJing a Kiehl's event I was gifted with this product (received it for free, but not paid to promote or review). It's been a year and I still have a month's worth left xo\",\n",
       " \"I use this for night time since I have really oily skin, it's pretty thick doesn't smell too strong but it is promising, gives me nourishment, I see less pores I love my skin in the morning . Also must try the overnight avocado cilantro mask\",\n",
       " 'This has been my go-to nighttime moisturizer for the last several years. I’ve tried more expensive brands (La Mer, Algenist, Amore Pacifica) but this is the best out there. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple but not oily or leaden.',\n",
       " \"I know that at first glance the price is a bit staggering for some of us, but this stuff is truly worth it! My skin feels so hydrated and soft, plus there's not an overpowering scent to this cream. It's also helping to soften my smile lines, which is a huge plus.\",\n",
       " \"Kiehl's products are always very reliable. It never gives me breakouts or any problems to my skin. This too is a great product that moisturizes and keeps my skin hydrated all night long. However, it needs to be used long term to see the difference in multi-correctiveness. The visible difference is minimal to my opinion. But if you want a good moisturizer for the night this is it.\",\n",
       " 'in spite of the price tag, this is a product well worth your money. spreads easily and absorbs well. makes me wake up with refreshed and brighter skin tone.',\n",
       " \"Not for use on greasy skin but gives great results and doesn't smell too strong. Great to throw on when running to store and don't have time to do a full skin routine.\",\n",
       " \"Wow, love this cream!  I received this cream as part of a Kiehl's gift set but didn't really expect to like it as I had tried and wasn't particularly impressed with the Ultra Facial Cream.   I typically use Shiseido and Algenist creams but love this cream much more.  It absorbs well and immediately made my skin feel baby soft.\",\n",
       " 'I like this product so far! It’s nice that it has a retinol in it so I am hopeful it will help with my minimal fine lines (I am 30 so they aren’t deep yet). It’s not super hydrating so I usually use this and then pat on a little extra eye cream, whichever one I’m using at the time.',\n",
       " 'Got this as a sample from Kiehl’s and I have to say it’s one of the few products that had helped me under eye dark circles. I have only used at night and wake up looking fresh and with significantly brighter under eyes. Have not tried during the day time but I would still recommend.',\n",
       " 'I got this as a sample and noticed change almost immediately - it really helped the little fine lines around my orbital bone. It’s super lightweight to put on. I don’t really wear face makeup so I can’t speak to application re makeup but goes on like a primer!',\n",
       " \"I love Kiehls products and I just finished my Kiehls midnight eye concentrate and saw this and thought why not? Especially w 20% off, I just used it today and obv I can't say what it's gonna do long haul but I put it on hours ago and my under eyes feel hydrated and plump, that's what I need and I'm trying to prevent those crows feet. It also has a peachy tint for using like a concealer primer or so the box says, I always forget to use my eye creams before concealer hopefully not this go around!\",\n",

       " 'This is a great cleanser for oily and sensitive skin. I used this for a while and wanted to try something new, so I started using a new cleanser which broke me out on my chin area so badly. Finally, I switched back to this clearer along with the matching toner. Within a week, my skin was already clearing up. Highly recommend and definitely work it to try it out!',\n",
       " 'Great to get oil off your face every morning and night, this product is my go to cleanser. A great combo with its toner! Love it!!',\n",
       " 'Great face wash!  My skin feels clean. It doesn’t leave that residue feeling.  My skin doesn’t feel stripped either. I have large pores and acne prone skin.  It works well with both. T foams well.  It has a very clean smell. It’s not floral or overly fruity.  I enjoy that. Everything doesn’t need to smell like a bed of roses.',\n",
       " \"I love this stuff and have been using it for years. Sometimes I stray and try something else, but I always come back to this. It's the most gentle yet effective cleanser I've ever tried. Highly recommend for combination skin as it's effective on oil but not drying. It's the perfect balance.\",\n",
       " 'Worth every penny! A little bit goes a long way so this product will definitely past quite a while. Truly has long term benefits. I find that when I use it one night in the beginning of the week I can find my lips remaining smoother and more moisturized for the remainder of the week.',\n",

       " \"I've been a fan of this luscious, foamy cleanser for over a year now and haven't found anything that is as gentle on my sensitive skin and also really works to remove makeup and oil! It leaves skin fresh and clean but not stripped of moisture. Also a little goes a long way, so this bottle last for a long time.

I shower at night so if I've worn makeup that day, ill start applying it just before I hop in the shower and then begin massaging into my skin with a bit of warm water from my shower. This is my favorite way to use this product and really any cleanser in general so that I dont make a mess at my sink. I generally use 3 pumps when I've worn a fill face of makeup and 1 pump if it was a very light makeup day with no mascara. This removes waterproof mascara with no issue and I've never experienced any stinging, redness, or any other eye irritation with this product. Ive even used this cleansing oil as a cleanser all by itsellf (I normally double cleanse when I use this for makeup removal) and my skin feels super clean and I never feel any leftover residue.

In texture, pimples, dullness. This stuff is really magic. & its lasts SO long! Ive had mine since March, still more than half full. Definitely worth the money! I'll use it forever!!!!\",\n",

Very earthy, natural smell. I’m here now to replace his tube since I just found the old one put out empty for me to replace - when your teen actually uses a product and asks for more, you buy it without asking questions! This is a great, not too expensive option for him.',\n",

It has the tiniest granules in it to make for a gentle exfoliation while also cleaning your face. My face feels fresh and soft after using this and doesn't feel dry at all. \\r\\r\\nThere is no real fragrance except for a slight earthy smell from the clay which is comforting. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good cleanser that won't dry out your skin.\",\n",

It will leave skin softer, but most serums do. For fine lines/wrinkles, it fails to deliver. I’ve used actual natural serums before that have done wonders, but for the price and questionable ingredients in this, I wouldn’t purchase.

When my skin is extremely dry to the point that it seems to be peeling or flaky, it’s hard to spread this product around when it’s not added to a moisturizer. I’m also unsure if it is good to use during the day for oily skin types. However, I plan to continue use and see what happens from there. I definitely love the smell as well as the softness this product gives my skin. I also see that it doesn’t clog my pores which I was worried it would or cause breakouts because it’s an oil, but I haven’t noticed anything like that so far. Hopefully that’ll stay the same, the only reason I wouldn’t rate this product 5/5 because I just can’t tell if it is good to use during the day on oily skin, my skin is rather oily even on dry days if that makes any sense, but anyway I’m unsure if it makes my skin look more oily or if it’s the same as always, but other than that it’s great, well and the price isn’t the best, but as many other serums you pay a lot for a small amount, but I do believe it’s worth it.',\n",

Plumper? I don't really know. It just looks better. Significantly better. Undeniably better. \\r\\r\\nMy skin is like a desert in the winter. Dry patches on my cheeks make it annoying to find a foundation that won't exacerbate the issue. I've had a lot fewer dry patches since I've started using this concentrate.

The result: my hair is shiny, full of volume, the ends feel smooth and hydrated, and it does not look limp and weighed down as I had feared! \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI think this is a product that will become a staple in my routine, and I can see myself using it 2-3 times a week, especially during the dry winter months (or during the summer after too much sun exposure).

My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of hair with no definitive wavy pattern but certainly not straight/smooth either. I love using this mask after my clarifying shampoo; I leave it on 10 minutes or so in the shower from the mid length to the ends of my hair. It has a creamy, slippery consistency, smells light and fresh, and really glides through the hair. It leaves my dry finicky hair vibrant, shiny, smoother, and more manageable. I still have to use a leave-in product of some kind to prevent my hair drying out as the day goes on but I think that's just a me-problem. Only complaint... I hate using tubs of product in the shower. This in a bottle of some kind would be phenomenal but I wouldn't knock a star for that\",\n",

Because I use prescription acne topicals that can be very drying, I alternate between a gel cleanser and this.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI use this as a cleanser, not a makeup remover. because I love the way it reacts to my bare skin. I remove my makeup with Sephora's makeup remover cloths and water, then slather this on, massage in and wipe with a warm wash cloth. I really love that the instructions says you don't have to emulsify it to activate it. So, it's not a drippy, messy process. Afterwards my skin is soft, soothed and supple. It's helps so much with my dry patches and has not triggered my acne. AND only one pump does the job!!\",\n",

In tandem with my other face wash, my skin looks so much less congested and so much clearer!

I have a hard time finding deep conditioners that work for me, because my hair tends to be very sensitive to new products. Usually, when I use a new shampoo or conditioner, my hair goes really frizzy afterwards and loses its curl pattern until it adjusts to the new product, if that ever happens. This is the only hair mask I've been able to use that both hydrates my hair and revives my curls without messing up my curl pattern. If another product has dried out my hair or thrown off my curl pattern, this product brings my curls back to life. This has some very effective ingredients, but it isn't overloaded with ingredients, and so it doesn't weigh my hair down. I have read that avocado oil is good for moisturizing curly hair.

I use about 6 products regularly, but this... this is my hair savior.

Thankfully I have the best colorist in the world who has gotten me into a good hair \"work out\" for the 2 weeks before we touch it- this mask for 5/10 minutes, two days later, the same with the Amika mask (deposit enough good stuff in your hair so when you lift from a 4 to a 9, you have all that extra protein to attack, rather than destroying your own hair!). I digress though. So I started with this as part of my workout about 4-5 years ago, loved it, totally saved my hair. Fell in love with the silkiness, how it evened out my oil issue, and my frizz was so far from an issue! I kept using it once a week (cold rinse for us color-treated gals!), and I kept rebuying as soon as the current jar was halfway done. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFlash forward about 2 years, my oldest daughter was just about 8- beautiful, long, thick, curly hair (always jealous of that lol!). But no anti-frizz product would really help, unless we piled on bottle after bottle of product after her shower. One day I suggested that she use her regular Amika shampoo, and the Kiehl\\'s as a conditioner (not a 5 minute mask!). She wrapped her hair in a turbie towel like always, but the screams of pure joy the next morning was enough to almost bring me to tears!

I love using cleansing oil at night because the water in my bathroom sink takes forever to warm up, and I am admittedly slightly lazy in my nighttime routine.

My hair did not stay smooth, nor did it feel moisturized at all. Yeah, it was a great shower experience, but I need a conditioner that will moisturize, soften, and smooth my hair. This didn't do anything beyond the shower, and I was left with hair that pretty much felt like I hadn't used anything (dry, coarse, frizzy). I did try a few different times (after clarifying, with various leave in products, different amounts of time sitting in hair) and nothing changed how it performed. I have low porosity hair, which can be hard to moisturize and soften, so maybe it just isn't a good fit for that hair type.

I also bring this with me on trips and it's perfect for protecting and rehydrating skin while traveling. A light layer at night if my skin is acting up and by morning it feels fresh and dewy again. Staple product in my collection.\",\n",
       " \"I'm a fan of having lots of masks on deck. This might feel more amazing in the dead of winter because the texture is rich, sticky, and thick. I tried to tissue off and sleep  with the mask as recommended but the texture was too sticky. BUT I love to wear it on work from home days, or lazy sundays. I feel the main perk is hydration\",\n",
       " 'This mask is mind-blowing. I always wake up with clear, even, incredibly soft skin. It is my favorite thing in my medicine cabinet. \\r\\r\\nIt is thick for sure, but I think if you apply according to the directions it’s not too bad and it’s overnight, so I don’t notice it cause I’m asleep. I don’t feel like I need to cover pillowcases or anything that extreme. \\r\\r\\nThank smell is nice, and a jar of it lasts a while, even when using it 3-4x per week. \\r\\r\\nI can’t recommend enough.',\n",
       " 'This stuff is seriously magic! I’ve had horrible cystic acne and some break outs and this stuff cleared everything almost instantly. I would also use this as a moisturizer day and night when my skin was bad. It cleared my skin and even helped with scaring, tone and texture. It’s one of my holy grails. I use it still, everyday. I love it.',\n",
       " 'Hands down the best mask I have ever owned. A friend loaned me hers because she was so impressed. I tried it once and bought my own! The scent is fresh and lovely. The mask is thick but not heavy and it doesn’t take much to cover the bottom 2/3  of my head of fine, straight hair. Every time I was and use this mask, too (about once a week) I get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks!\\r\\r\\nIt leaves my hair smooth and silky and does not weigh it down. I have normal hair that is fine so I do not use this at the root. I loaned mine to two friends and both bought their own and love it.',\n",

It saved my hair after bleaching multiple times and then return to brown.. my hair became very frizzy constantly.. after using this my hair returned to it silky state.. a little bit of this product goes a long way and mine lasted a little less then a year if not more',\n",

Small amount is potent enough to leave your hair silky and soft. I blow out my hair slightly at the ends and noticed how well my hair kept that slinky, shiny de frizzed mode until the next shampoo, after using this product. A new favorite and considering the small amount required each use, also fairly affordable.\",\n",

The former blue herbal gel cleanser was my holy grail product that I and my husband had been using for over 7 years.  It would effectively remove debris, oil and makeup and kept my face fresh, healthy and clean. I have attempted to find a replacement and tried 7-8 cleansers from Kiehls and other brands and there is nothing that will suffice or is as effective as the old blue herbal gel cleanser.  If I knew this was being discontinued I would have purchased all the remaining stock. This is AWFUL!!!',\n",

I have combo skin, acne-prone and sensitive, and this cleanser keeps my skin free of pimple, acnes and oil. The best thing is that it's affordable and the size is perfect, because a little goes a long way, so you won't run out of it too soon. It's my 3rd time purchasing it, and I will stick to it, along with Kiehls Acne Lotion, which is a must have too!\",\n",

After doing some research I learned that you should not use this cleanser constantly, only when needed ;). I’ve been using this one at night and a gentle cleanser in the morning & my skin has yet to become dry! I’d say give it a chance — the price is great too (if you don’t like it, you can always return it). This cleanser works especially well with other Kiehl’s products (toners, face oils, moisturizers). Totally recommend!!!',\n",

I am a dedicated Clinique user but needed a product with salycyclic acid in it to clear the breakouts. This product is amazing! It smells minty and fresh and leaves your skin tingling after you use it. I immediately noticed that my red inflamed pimples had decreased in size and redness one day after using. It's great at keeping skin clear after your breakouts are gone as well. I've also noticed that my wrinkles are less noticeable since using this and that the surface of my skin looks smoother and pores more refined. GREAT product and zero allergy irritation!\",\n",
       " \"WHY would Kiehls discontinue the blue herbal gel cleanser for this one???? I've used this one for over a week and experienced breakouts and unhappy skin. I'm not happy with the new consistency as its thick and runs out into the cap when stored after use. The gel cleanser was lighter, a better formula and much more effective than this one. I called kiehl's and they told me this one was rejuvenated to a better formula. I have to disagree. I've used the gel cleanser for a long time now and very disappointed that this is the replacement! I don't know why companies do this; you have a great product and attempt to revamp it or discontinue it when consumers have no issues with it. If it's not broken don't try to fix it. Bring back the gel cleanser!!!! Asking for a wide audience of consumers. I will be returning this.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know WHY Kiehl's had to go and mess with a very good thing, but this is not the same as the Blue Herbal Gel Cleanser that came in the bigger plastic bottle. Super disappointing as this was my favorite cleanser and I used it daily with my Clarisonic brush.\",\n",

I will be returning ASAP and do not recommend this product. It did not help or treat my acne, did not sooth my face.. just created more breakouts.',\n",

After switching shampoos to control the oily roots, I started noticing my hair wasn't blowing out as nicely as I like it to be with the creme. I was happy to discover Kiehl's had made a serum version of Silk Groom and decided to give that a try. I'm so glad that I did.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nEven though the serum is an oil formula it is not very greasy. I have fine hair, two drops is enough to keep the flyaways away and leave me with sleek straight hair.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOnce again Kiehl's has a loyal fan for life with the Silk Groom products.\",\n",

I needed something gentle because most body washes over dry my skin, and this is perfect. Smells amazing too. I’d definitely recommend this to any dry/rough/bumpy skin sufferers.',\n",

       " 'This shower oil smells very artificial to me. It’s somewhat moisturizing and suds up somewhat but I cannot use it because I can’t get over the smell. I just looked up the ingredients on the bottle and sure enough, there’s fragrance added. I would not repurchase.',\n",

A little goes a looong way. Once I apply, it's easily absorbed, and by morning my skin feels very hydrated and moisturized! No heavy scents either, very pleasing. I've been looking for night creams that will do the job, but don't clog my pores, and I think I've finally found it in this cream!

I avoid mousse, gels, hairspray....I don\\'t like the way they make my hair feel. I leave in some conditioner (usually just Deva Curl One Condition, sometimes a little Humectress or Paul Mitchell The Cream run through the ends), and wrap it in an Aquis microfiber towel. When I take off the towel, I spray some color lock-in spray (for color treated hair) onto my hair, and then squeeze a small ribbon of the Creme with Silk Groom into my hand and spray some Deva Curl Set it Free into my hand as well (about a dozen or so pumps of spray). I mix the two products together in my hands, and run it over and through my hair, concentrating on all the ends. Occasionally (rarely) I\\'ll add a few drops of Bio Silk or Repair and Shine to my mixture if we\\'re going out and it\\'s supposed to be a rainy or very humid day. I part my hair, position a few curls how/where I want them to fall, and let air and hair do the rest. Once it\\'s dry, I can fluff or tousle my hair to give it some fullness at the crown, but that\\'s it. The Creme with Silk Groom--Set of Free combo helps to form soft, bouncy curls without leaving them greasy or crunchy.  \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAlso, I\\'m sensitive to fragrances in hair products, and I find the scent to be pleasant and subtle.',\n",

Unlike other shine products on the market, it NEVER looks heavy or greasy. The best way to use this is on towel-dried hair to help smooth your hair (it will retain its natural curl/wave) or use it to create shine at the ends of dry hair. The finish is always reflective and chic, NEVER a doused-in-oil effect or a \"fake\" shine which many other products emit once on the hair (especially dark hair). \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI am Mexican with medium wavy, somewhat fine-to-normal hair. My father has thinning straight hair and both of us have successfully used this produce for eons. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI cannot recommend this product enough.',\n",

I can honestly say that after a week of use (night time only) my skin looked noticeably different -  more of an overall glowy, radiant complexion. I was shocked at how much I liked this product and what a difference it actually made and with continued use my skin has only improved. I definitely would recommend for people with more sensitive skin or those who have had negative reactions to other essences.',\n",

I find that after applying, especially overnight and layered with my serums, my face glows and seems more awake in the morning. However, my issue lies in the ingredients. This essence claims to boost moisture levels in the skin but with the addition of alcohol, I felt like my cheeks and the area on the sides of my nose became dry and tight an hour or two after applying. I do find that this does have a tendency to break me out from time to time which is unfortunate because the texture is wonderful and the amount of product you get is a great value for the price!\",\n",

After dabbling a bit with essence by trying several different samples, all of which I love, I ended buying this one based on the price and the reviews that it’s pretty powerful stuff. All the essences I’ve tested plump the face and make the skin really soft, including this one. However, this one seems to have the most skin resurfacing ability! I use it twice a day by pouring a bit into my palms and then patting my face right after cleansing and a spritz of floral water. A little goes a long way, so I expect this will last quite a while. Next is serum, then moisturizer. This stuff has completely changed the texture of my skin, and it’s now smoother and brighter. Can’t say much for oil control because I’m very oily. Overall I really love this product, and while I still want to try a few other essences after this one, for the price and performance, this can’t be beat. Very highly recommend!!',\n",

Obviously this is a maintenance thing, so I have to use it if I don't want my texture to come back, but this product has done for me what other similar chemical exfoliants from brands like Origins, Ole Henrickson, Sunday Riley and even Drunk Elephant could not.

Which sounds odd, but I think its awesome. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI usually just keep tapping it in, with very little, very light circular rubs to help rub it in. But once I have a nice thin layer spread on my face, I let it sit in for about 5-10 minutes. Then I add a small amount of face oil to top off (my personal fave is squalane oil). \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nYou do not have to have very dry skin for this. In face, if you have naturally oily skin, I would say this will also be awesome because your natural oils (that you need) will help dissolve this balm and you get a second round of effect. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nRegardless, best moisturizer all around for its money. I won\\'t be changing any time soon as long as they don\\'t change their formula (this also contains vitamin E and Lavender oils, both very good for your skin). \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI am relieved and in heaven.',\n",

I have noticed that the skin under my eyes when doing my makeup does not tug anymore. I'm able to apply my wings liner more effectively and there are no lines that my makeup really settles into under the eye area not to mention it's also become more light and and brightened because that skin has become more strong and resilient.

I love that I can just quickly spray it on and rub it in and I'm done, and it doesn't leave behind any greasiness on the skin or hands. It smells lightly of vanilla and almond.

I tend to like gourmand and vanilla smells, but Kiehl\\'s really missed the mark with this one. It is really off-putting for me, and is why I knocked two stars off.

It\\'s hands down one of the best body oils I\\'ve tried.

Anyone in my position knows how tough it is to find high quality products that fit these criteria. If that's you, here you go! You get: sheer tint with nothing that even suggests makeup, pretty but natural colors, a feeling even less intrusive than chapstick, healthy ingredients, and surprisingly effective moisturization. I find a barely noticeable (pleasant) scent, but it dissipates more or less instantly. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe only thing is, it doesn't last very long.

I use this as my last step over my serums and regular pm cream. also works well over retinol or acids. my skin looks hydrated, clear and plump. the plumping effect makes my pores vanish and I think this stuff helps heal pimples or breakouts. I say that bc sometimes I go to bed with a few blemishes and when I use this mask, they're gone in the am. I've used it over irritated, over exfoliated skin and wake up healed. it doesn't clog my pores either. I apply a very thin layer and that eliminates the need to wipe off excess. the only negative I can find is that it can be a little sticky if you use too much. but it's not a deal breaker for me.

       " 'This is a light moisturizer and smells very nice and clean. Consistency is like a little bit heavier hydrating primer. I live in the midwest in a very dry climate so I need something a bit more moisturizing. If I move back to the east coast I will try it again!',\n",
       " \"I got this because I really liked Energie de Vie Smoothing and Plumping Lotion. I figured it would be best to pair them. This certainly is a great moisturizer. It's light, and brightens and softens the face, but I wasn't as blown away as I was with the lotion. I don't find it does much for uneven complexions and blotchiness. It also gives this tingling feeling which makes me suspect there is a great deal of alcohol in the product. Overall though, not bad.\",\n",
       " \"I love this moisturizer. It's hydrating without making my skin oily. My skin looks visibly softer and younger.\",\n",
       " \"I love this moisturizer by Lancome. I've read other reviews that mention compatibility issues with foundation but since I don't use foundation I can not speak to that. This is really hydrating on my skin but needs a few moments to soak in and dry. It gives a glow but not greasy looking.\",\n",
       " 'Some have reviewed the strong perfume scent of this cream, but I didnt smell anything.  I like how it goes on light and clean.  I feel fresh.  Keeps my skin soft and supple in the day time.  Lasts through the long cold winter months in canada.  Makes my face look fresh and bright',\n",
       " 'BEST LASH PRIMER EVER okay before lash primer especially this one is amazing my lashes are always falling down or going down but with this it stays up',\n",
       " 'I strongly recommend this product. My eyelashes were thin and soft (like my hair) so I was looking for a rescue when I don’t really make up. For experimental purpose I applied this enhance mascara only to right eyelashes for one week and wow! They outgrow the left eyelashes with significant progress. \\r\\r\\nI would say for those who are not born with long, thick eyelashes this enhance mascara is something you can count on. It’s mild, doesn’t cause any fall out for me and convenient, wash face normally without the need for removing “makeup”.',\n",
       " 'I cannot express how much I love this product. I cannot do without it. My lashes are sparse and short - used to be almost invisible. Using this as a base coat makes them visible and it seems to pick up every lash. Every mascara looks better with this, and it helps with removal, making more stubborn mascaras easier to remove at the end of the day. I’ve been using this for a year and my lashes have actually gotten longer and thicker. Highly highly recommend.',\n",
       " 'Still my favorite primer. I found that my regular size would dry out before I used all the product, so this mini size will allow me to actually utilize what I paid for.',\n",
       " 'Perfect primer for the lashes, makes my mascara last all day and enhances everything. Perfect size for travel. Just great product overall. Lashes never looked better!',\n",
       " 'Goes on white and when applied correctly lengthens lashes underneath mascara and prevents clumping. Would recommend, Ive had no problems with it',\n",
       " 'I gave it 4 stars only because the price is high and the smell was strong to me. It did plump I was surprised my faces looks a little lifted and my under eyes looked great!',\n",
       " 'I’m super picky about sheet masks, and this one meets all the criteria on my checklist. I wore it for about 45 minutes on a flight, and my skin was glowing, plump, super soft and radiant after the flight. $15 is a great price considering it has the same amount of bifidus as a jar of Genefique!! Get this. You’ll be stocking up.',\n",
       " 'I wanted to like this product, as I already use many Lancôme products and was glad to get a sample of it as part of a bonus time to try. I used after the Genifique serum as suggested, and my skin felt sticky and a little itchy.',\n",
       " 'Too heavy and thick.  Yes I Love and have to have long gorgeous lashes but this absolutely did not work for mine, I also didn’t prefer it flaking..',\n",
       " 'I’ve done many, MANY sheet masks over the years.  I had very high hopes for this one when I saw that Lancôme had come out with their own sheet mask.  I love Lancôme and I love Genifique.  I mean, it has a whole 30 ml bottle of the serum on the mask!  How could I go wrong here?  Well...let me tell you about my experience so far.  I can’t yet speak about it’s effectiveness (sorry!)....because I’m still wearing the mask.  I’m trying it for the first time as I type this.   I can immediately say, however, that l do NOT like how this mask fits the face (its way too large, and I don’t even have a small face!) and I also don’t like how it slides around on my face instead of staying put.  It’s just too large and I have to keep readjusting it because otherwise it’s sliding down on my face and the area around my eyes isn’t getting any serum.  This mask also will NOT stay put.  It’s rolling up around the edges (especially the left side) and I have to continually pat it back down and readjust it on my face.  Ok, this is annoying.  It had better show amazing results, because if it’s anything less than amazing. I won’t repurchase.  I like the Tatcha mask much better.  Hands down.  I’ll revise my review IF the results are stunning.  If just average though, I’d go with Tatcha over this one.  And it’s STILL pulling up around the edges after being in for 10 minutes.  Ugh.  Lancome, I love you but you need to come up with a better sheet mask.  One that actually stays ON the face.',\n",
       " 'I have combination, oily skin. So, I am always on the lookout for gel or water based moisturizers for my face. On the plus side, this cream did not break me out, a good sign in my book. But it did not feel smooth and nice in my skin. It left my skin feeling sticky, something I do not expect from a water based cream. An average face cream.',\n",
       " \"I mean, quite literally, it's like layering full-power old lady perfume on your face. And I LOVE things that smell. I am a five-Lush-products-at-once kinda girl. But this stuff is SO heavily fragranced ... not a nice, healthy, natural essential oils smell. I mean a heavy, fake, perfume smell. I washed it frantically off as soon as I patted it on.\\r\\r\\nUgh.\\r\\r\\nLancome. Get it together. It's not the 60s anymore.\",\n",
       " 'I LOVE this product. My face was really really dry so I started using this twice a day before I apply my primer and foundation and at night after I wash my face. It has worked amazing for me my face it nice and soft now.',\n",
       " 'THE BEST!  NO STINGING or burning,  it does its job like no other.',\n",
       " 'This stuff is worth every penny, never going back to wipes. 3-4  gentle swipes and even heavy mascara comes off. I use this in combination with the Clinique Take the Day Off balm and together they get everything off of my face.',\n",
       " 'I decided to buy this after seeing such great reviews and seriously after one use I was stunned at how great this stuff is. Worth every penny. I only used a few drops and I was in disbelief when I saw how this product had removed every bit of my make up and did not irritate my eyes or skin AT ALL. Usually make up removers will burn my eyes or skin a little bit but not at all with this stuff. I think I’ve found my new holy grail!!',\n",
       " 'removes even the thickest layer of waterproof mascara and eye makeup without irritating my eyes. You only need a couple of drops to remove your entire eye makeup so a little goes a long way. No rubbing required, just lightly press the lashes on the cotton pad.',\n",
       " 'Got this as a sample from my last purchase from Lancôme, i just love it. It makes me feel beautiful. Definitely getting one soon',\n",
       " \"I think this is one of the most beautiful scents I've ever worn. I loved the original La Vie Est Belle, but I like this more. It lacks the supersweet gourmand notes, but keeps a deep, warm, semi-sweet vanilla note that lingers nicely. I love the orange blossom at the opening. I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance.\",\n",
       " 'Love this smell. This is my favorite perfume. Floral/fruity smell.',\n",
       " \"I have always heard about the original La Vie Est Belle but when I first tried it out, I didn't really enjoy the opening notes, namely the black currant. So after a while of giving up on the cult favorite, I discovered this flanker during a visit to Sephora and (after not getting that initial hit of black currant) was obsessed in seconds! It doesn't have as much sharpness in the opening notes as the original, (though it can come off a little stronger). I also love the dry down, as the base notes are a great combination of vanilla, patchouli, and sandalwood. And it lasts forever! I'm talking about more than 16 hours and DAYS on clothing after only two sprays in the morning. Overall,  it is a great fragrance that everyone should at least try out once.\",\n",
       " 'Literally the best smell ever! The only complaint I have is that the bottle seems big but it’s all glass and little product.',\n",
       " \"I love the scent - doesn't seem to stay with me though throughout the day.  I would not buy again because of that.\",\n",
       " 'This is a lovely fragrance and is light and fresh!',\n",
       " 'If you love the original la vie est belle and want a Perfume that is a bit deeper with more vanilla notes in it, this is your girl. I receive so many compliments when I wear this scent so it’s definitely a new favorite.',\n",
       " \"The best of the best! This scent makes me feel beautiful and lasts all day! I originally found out this perfume from my sister, she got a magazine ad insert with the scent on it. She wanted it so bad but didn't want to splurge. I ended up going to sephora one day and bought it for her - for christmas. I couldn't resist spraying it on myself at the store.. or once she opened it. I am buying one for myself now. Even my husband likes it. It's a hit!!!!\",\n",
       " \"I love this moisturizer. I have combination oily skin and usually creams on my face are either not moisturizing enough or they are too oily, creamy for my skin and make me break out.\\r\\r\\r\\nMy skin looks visibly softer and younger.\\r\\r\\r\\nDon't need too much, moisturizing.\\r\\r\\r\\n I personally love the smell\",\n",
       " 'I got this after trying the starter kit. Its a great moisturizer (makes my skin feel \"plump\" and soft)  and a little bit goes a LONG way. I\\'m not a huge fan of the fragrance but it does not last long and its not overpowering. I think it\\'ll be a little too heavy for my combination skin come the Florida humid summer, but I will still use it for a night cream even if I don\\'t use it during the day. Overall, I\\'m glad i purchased it.',\n",
       " \"I was so excited to try this.  Got this as a sample.  However, it does not work well with my oily skin. I used it as my night time moisturizer.   It feels so smooth, light, and refreshing when you apply it.  I wake up in the morning with super oily shine!  More than normal.  I did my research that says your skin will produce more oil if it isn't receiving enough moisture or hydration.  There is also a minor irritation in my forehead.  I had to stop using it.\",\n",
       " \"I have been on the lookout for a great lightweight moisturizer that sinks in quickly but still feels hydrating. This is by far the best I have tried yet! It feels silky and light but also like I just splashed water on my face. I felt hydrated all day. It has a really fresh but really light scent. It made my makeup stay on longer and my skin looked happy all day. I am so so happy I found this stuff. Next time I'm going to try the liquid lotion essence in this line. It's so different!\",\n",
       " \"As far as the moisturizing and hydration, this moisturizer delivers- but I have found other moisturizers that do a much better job of doing this, for less than the price of this guy. Also was not in love with the way it looked underneath foundation (I use water-based foundations with satiny or dewy finishes, so I don't know why it didn't mix perfectly with a water-based moisturizer- maybe it's just my skin.)\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI used a full jar of this and although it did help my dry skin out, it didn't drastically improve the texture that I sometimes have due to dehydration.\",\n",
       " \"I've only used a sample of this product so I can't speak to the full range of benefits or how effective the product is when used long-term. As someone with sensitive skin, I will say that this product is very heavily scented and smells like perfume. Not a bad smell but strong. I'm weary of strongly scented products and find that they are more likely to irritate sensitive skin.\",\n",

It is a little on the greasy side and leaves a little layer of residue but that doesn't bother me as much as it bothers others. **I can't speak to it's usefulness when it comes to waterproof makeup as i don't use those formulas** will definitely re-purchase.\",\n",
       " 'It’s great for taking off layers of mascara and eyeshadow. I use 2 cotton pads, put some on both and just let them sit on my eyes for at least 20-30 secs just so it breaks down the thick layer of mascara I usually have on. Only downfall for me is trying to remove the mascara underneath my eyes, other then that it’s great!',\n",

I think the one thing that I really do like about this is once I put it on, I can't smell it...unlike the original- I can smell it all day.  And I get SO MANY compliments when I wear this.  I hope this is not a limited edition, I am really happy to add this to my collection.\",\n",

This has become my signature scent. This is what my children and grandchildren will remember me smelling like. It's a beautiful smell. It stays with me all day and get's better and better as the hours go by. I also have the powder, which is fabulous! I hope beyond hope that this stays around for many more years to come.

Ive tried countless moisturizers and this one has been my favorite, not too heavy and the scent isn't too strong like some of Lancomes other moisturizers. It is not too oily and my makeup sits perfectly on top of it. I can also tell a difference in my skin, it has been dull lately so thats why i decided to try this. Ive been using it for a month, the improvement isn't drastic but it is significant, my skin is a little more glowy and less ruddy or red. The only thing i don't like about it is the price because it may only last about 3 months and that it comes in a jar and not a pump. I will most likely buy it again though\",\n",
